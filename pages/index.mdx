Drive Forward is a place where Ontario undergraduate students (we also welcome ontario high school students!) with almost no experience in technology or are well versed in the industry can come to get resources and guidance to learn and create technological solutions to real world transportation and logistics problems. 

As we've seen during the pandemic, supply chain issues (issues with systems that transport goods for businesses and even packages that you order) have been amplitfied since so many of us are using online orders. Youâ€™ll walk away with new technical, design and business skills, a project to brag about, and maybe even a prize!

## Schedule

Drive Forward is open to students of all levels, which is why we hold workshops on technical, business, and design topics to help you create the best possible project. We also have a lot of fun activities planned throughout the event along with great speakers and panel dicussions. The judging criteria has been created to be fair to all groups regardless of skill level. Projects will be judged on their ability to address the three following aspects in whatever transportation problem was chosen. 

- Social Responsibility
- Environment
- Economic Growth
