As we've seen during the pandemic, supply chain issues have been amplified since so many of us are using online orders, help create solutions to this *regardless of your skill level* and youâ€™ll walk away with new technical, design and business skills, a project to brag about, and **maybe even a prize**!

## Schedule

Drive Forward is open to students of all levels, which is why we hold workshops on technical, business, and design topics to help you create the best possible project. We also have a lot of fun activities planned throughout the event along with great speakers and panel dicussions. The judging criteria has been created to be fair to all groups regardless of skill level. Projects will be judged on their ability to address the three following aspects in whatever transportation problem was chosen.
